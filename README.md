# Fun-with-fans
Fun-with-fans is the individual project of the IoT course of the master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome. Nowadays consumption for heating buildings is a big problem due to rising prices, for this reason I think about to build an intelligent system that allows to turn on and turn off for example a fan in an intelligent way, in order to reduce the energy consumption.
